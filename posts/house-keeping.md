title: Dealing with embarrassment

Going through my CV, portfolio, and GitHub, I've realized that I'm really ashamed of the way I keep my documents and directories organized, as well as how my previous projects are written, and even the way I think. This uncomfortable feeling persisted throughout Monday as I attempted to make sense of my last two years without employment while updating my portfolio and CV after completing a 13-week software development bootcamp with Northcoders. Given the option of staying stuck in negativity or confronting it, I chose the latter. And what I found wasn't as bad as I'd feared.

## Why so many?

84... 84 repositories! I really felt bad about it! I thought that because I have so many of them I should be more experienced and knowledgeable than I am.
Then, reading the code I wrote made me feel even worse. But I can see now that it is from a period where I was learning on my own; trying to swim in that ocean of possibilities is hard.
I have felt ashamed that even with those many repostitories, I am not better in creating.
Now, I know that I have created them simply because I wanted to explore this new world, and I have done that in the way I knew, not good, not bad, just mine. I have learned a lot during that process, and what is most important I kept motivated even when I have cried with fruistration when I was enable to solve configuration or logic issues.

There always is room for improvement, but I know that I do have determination and willingness to spend my time doing it and it definitely counts for something.

## Seriously, 2 years?

After I resigned from my position in 2022, I spent time learning about myself, computers, the internet, and programming.  
That time was like a rollercoaster; there were days when I was so afraid of failure that I perceived the whole process as taking forever and it made me really dislike myself, and there were days where I felt proud of myself.
And now, after completing bootcamp with Northcoders, I finally understand that building stuff is mostely fun, and discovering new ways is actually the whole point of learning and living in general (a bit dramatic but true), and I should look for fun in it.
So simple, and yet it was so hard for me to truly understand that.
The time I have spent learning basics with Codecademy and Brilliant was not wasted.
It gave me an understanding of technical concepts, but it also showed me that learning on my own is a difficult task because sometimes I get stuck with my thoughts that aren't productive.
Bootcamp showed me how to stay on topic while trying to understand new areas and that I'm able to solve problems, and cooperate with others.
It served as a catalyst for reflection, highlighting areas for improvement and reaffirming my capabilities.

## What is next?

Changing the background of that blog! It is too yellow!  
I will just try to be proud of myslef more and more every day.  
I really like solving problems, building, and the learning process. I like to be a part of a team.
I decided that I will keep practice projects out of portfolio.
Should I just start to follow correct patterns or try to rebuild everything?
